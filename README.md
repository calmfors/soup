## Soup Delivery
An online food delivery app built with react and firebase.

* Eight soups divided in five categories.

* Maximum four optional toppings for each soup.

* Five different choices of drinks.

* Order is only possible during the opening hours of the (fictive) restaurant.

* Choose between pick up or delivery.

* Possible to send as a soupogram with attached message to a friend.

* Everyone can browse the soups but only signed in users can order. 

* Signed in users with order history can order their favourite order again.

* Signed in admins (all signed in users for the moment, wip) have the option to edit soup title, description, price and toppings, and also choose categories.

* Tracking page will be implemented in the future.

* [UX-prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/kgZVmY3Tr6EQUgLsXTVPgo/Soup?node-id=208%3A1703&scaling=min-zoom) and logo made in Figma.

* App is deployed at [calmfors.se/soup](http://calmfors.se/soup/).
